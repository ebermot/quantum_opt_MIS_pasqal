# quantum_opt_MIS_pasqal

Welcome everyone, and thank you for joining today’s **QuanTech workshop**!  
In this project, you will learn the key concepts behind **quantum optimization with neutral atoms**, with a focus on Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problems.

Most of the material is contained in the notebook `project.ipynb`.  
If anything is unclear or missing, feel free to ask questions during the session.

## 🧪 Setup Instructions

We recommend working in a dedicated Python virtual environment.

### 1. Create a virtual environment

    python -m venv quantech

### 2. Activate the environment

    source quantech/bin/activate

### 3. Recommended editor

We strongly recommend using **VS Code**, as it provides a smooth and convenient workflow for Jupyter notebooks.
